//           "1. Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates\n\nStarchy carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals. Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on. They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer. Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat. Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.\n\n\n2. Eat lots of fruit and veg\n\nIt's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Getting your 5 A Day is easier than it sounds. Why not chop a banana over your breakfast cereal, or swap your usual mid-morning snack for a piece of fresh fruit? A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g. A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.\n\n\n3. Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adults\n\nEating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke. Even if you do not add salt to your food, you may still be eating too much. About three-quarters of the salt you eat is already in the food when you buy it, such as breakfast cereals, soups, breads and sauces. Use food labels to help you cut down. More than 1.5g of salt per 100g means the food is high in salt. Adults and children aged 11 and over should eat no more than 6g of salt (about a teaspoonful) a day. Younger children should have even less.\n\n\n4. Dont skip breakfast\n\nSome people skip breakfast because they think it'll help them lose weight. But a healthy breakfast high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt can form part of a balanced diet, and can help you get the nutrients you need for good health. A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.",

//           "1. Sit on the floor\n\n OK, it may not be as comfy as your super-squashy sofa, but according to studies of the world’s longest-living populations, sitting on the floor can help us stay healthier for longer. For example, in Okinawa in Japan, home to the longest-living women in the world, most sitting, whether to read, eat or talk, is done on the floor. The reason it’s so beneficial? Repeatedly standing from a seated position on the floor is good for flexibility, strength and co-ordination, which are all known to have favourable influences on life expectancy.\n\n\n 2. Drip with health\n\nA small knob of butter or light drizzle of oil on veggies isn’t just delicious, but can be health helpful, too. “Some nutrients, such as vitamins A, D, E and K (found in green vegetables and sweet potatoes) are fat soluble so a smidgen of fat, such as olive oil, helps with nutrient absorption,” says Ian Marber, a leading independent nutrition therapist (ianmarber.com).\n\n\n 3. Wean off wine o’clock\n\nA glass of wine in the evening might help you fall asleep, but can impact the quality of your slumber, leaving you sluggish the following day. To help prevent this, avoid drinking close to bedtime to give your body time to process the alcohol. As a rough guide, it’s thought to take one hour for your body to process one unit of alcohol, although this varies between individuals. To find out more about the units in your drink – and to ensure you’re not exceeding the maximum 14 units a week – use the Unit Calculator on drinkaware.co.uk.\n\n\n4. Cuddle up\n\nIn one study, volunteers who had regular hugs over a two-week period were found to be less likely to catch a cold. It’s believed this is because hugs are one of the fastest ways to get the feel-good chemical oxytocin flowing in the body, which helps to reduce stress and, in turn, protect immunity.\n\n\n",

//           "1. BRUSH YOUR TEETH TWICE A DAY FOR TWO MINUTES EACH TIME.\n\nKeeping your teeth clean and healthy begins with regular maintenance. Brushing for two minutes at a time twice a day, known as the 2x2 rule, will help to keep plaque at bay. Patients with children should introduce this concept early, and find ways to make it fun. You can play a song while they're brushing, or use a timer to know when two full minutes have passed. To make it easier to clean every tooth, try to spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth (upper right side, upper left side, lower right side, lower left side). Using the right techniques are important to ensure the teeth are being cleaned properly and you aren't damaging the soft tissue around them. Using small circular motions, angle the head of the brush towards the gums. Be sure to clean all surfaces, as well as along the gum line, both on the fronts and backs of your teeth. Some patients find using an electric toothbrush helps as well.\n\n\n2. FLOSS DAILY.\n\nIt's recommended to floss every night before brushing to remove anything your toothbrush is unable to dislodge. Many patients admit to skipping this step, but it is an important part of a healthy routine. If you only brush and decide you don't need to floss, small particles of food and other deposits that are missed by your toothbrush can eventually develop into decay. To avoid this, make sure you take two minutes a day to add flossing to your routine. When you first start flossing, it may cause sensitive gums to hurt. This is natural and will stop once you've been flossing for a couple days. When flossing, make sure you slide it up and down along the whole tooth. Don't ignore tight spaces, this is one of the most important places to floss as your toothbrush can't reach these areas.\n\n\n3. REPLACE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH AT THE SIGNS OF WEAR. As a general rule, changing it about every 3 to 6 months should keep it in shape to clean your teeth properly. Damaged or frayed toothbrushes can't clean the surface of your teeth correctly and can cause damage to your gums. Replacing your toothbrush often also allows you to help keep it clean. Always rinse your toothbrush well and store it so it can dry. Remember to replace your toothbrush if you've been sick to prevent bacteria from being re-introduced into your mouth.\n\n\n4. VISIT YOUR DENTIST EVERY SIX MONTHS.\n\nYour dentist will be able to prevent issues before they start, or at least to catch them early, if you have regular dental appointments. Regular visits also allow your teeth to get a thorough professional cleaning twice a year, removing any buildup of plaque and tartar, which helps to keep your teeth and gums healthy.\n\n\n5. MAINTAIN A HEALTHY DIET.\n\nAvoiding sweetened foods (such as pop, sports drinks, and candy) as well as including foods high in calcium will help to support strong and heay teeth. As a side benefit, your body will thank you too! Some foods that will help to strengthen your teeth include leafy greens, almonds, yogurt, and cheese. Speak to your dentist for recommendations of foods that will help keep your teeth strong for years to come.",

//           "1. Do not skip breakfast\n\nSkipping breakfast will not help you lose weight. You could miss out on essential nutrients and you may end up snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry.\n\n\n2. Eat regular meals\n\nEating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar.\n\n\n3. Eat plenty of fruit and veg\n\nFruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3 essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.\n\n\n4. Get more active\n\nBeing active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing lots of health benefits, exercise can help burn off the excess calories you cannot lose through diet alone. Find an activity you enjoy and are able to fit into your routine.\n\n\n5. Drink plenty of water\n\nPeople sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need.\n\n\n6. Eat high fibre foods\n\nFoods containing lots of fibre can help keep you feeling full, which is perfect for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg, oats, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta, and beans, peas and lentils.\n\n\n7. Read food labels\n\nKnowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options. Use the calorie information to work out how a particular food fits into your daily calorie allowance on the weight loss plan.\n\n\n8. Use a smaller plate\n\nUsing smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls, you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.\n\n\n9. Do not ban foods\n\nDo not ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There's no reason you cannot enjoy the occasional treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance.\n\n\n10. Do not stock junk food\n\nTo avoid temptation, do not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice.\n\n\n11. Cut down on alcohol\n\nA standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain.\n\n\n12. Plan your meals\n\nTry to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick to your calorie allowance. You may find it helpful to make a weekly shopping list.\n\n\n",
